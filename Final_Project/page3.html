            <h1>Hobbies</h1>
            <h2><u>Running</u></h2>
            <h3> I have been running for about 4 years of my life when I first started going to Chicago Math and Science Academy as part of the track and field team. I joined track and field because my mom wasn't able to pick me up right after school and I needed to do something to pass time. Although I joined track and field to pass time, it quickly changed into a hobby and a motive to become healthier and faster. Today, I look forward to track everyday and can't imagine life without it. </h3>

          <h2><u>Soccer</u></h2>
          <h3>Soccer has been my hobby since I can remember. I have always loved to play and watch soccer. When I was young, my cousin, who played soccer on a daily basis, used to teach me cool trick so I can show off to my neighborhood friends. As I grew up, my cousing started to tae me to play competetive games with older guys so I can gain experience and have fun. I also used to play soccer for Chicago Math and Science Academy and Joyce Kilmer. I, however, didn't try-out for the Lane Tech soccer team because I wanted to get used to the new school first. </h3>

          <h2><u>Swimming</u></h2>
          <h3>Swimming has been a hobby of mine since I was a toddler. My uncle used to take me to a swimming pool in India, where I first learned to swim. He used to push me to face my fear of the deep water and to just jump right in. Once I did it, it was amazing. Since then I loved swimming. I go to the swimming pool everyday of every summer with my friends just to relax and play in the water. Swimming has become one of my favorite hobbies, ever since the day I first learned to swim. </h3>
