            <h2><u>Track and Field</u></h2>
            <h3>I have been competing in Track and Field for 3-4 years and I have won a couple of awards. I was given a ribbon for finishing 6th in the 4x100m relay when I was in 7th grade. I also won a bronze medal for the same event (4x400m relay) in 8th grade. I won the two medals in the City Championships. In 6th grade, I was able to qualify for regionals for the 100m and 200m, but I was not able to make the cut for City Championships. I also qualified for regionals for the 100m in both 7th and 8th grade as well.</h3>

            <h2><u>Soccer</u></h2>
            <h3>I have won 2 city championships while playing soccer. When I used to play for Kilmer, we won the city championships. I was in 5th grade and it was my first time playing for a school team. I did not play a lot because most of the team was 6th graders and I was only in 5th grade. I was still really happy when we won and my coach decided to play me the whole game during the finals. The 2nd time I won city championships was in 8th grade. This time I was way more experienced and had played more throughout the season. This, however, didn't change the feeling I felt when I realized I won. I was more nervous this time though because the game was a tie and we had to go into penalty shootouts. My team was also a runner up when I was in 7th grade and I was devastated when I realized we had lost. </h3>

            <h2><u>Lane Tech</u></h>
            <h3>I have not had many academic achievements, other than being valedictorian and getting into lane tech, as my athletic achievements. When I got an email informing me that I had been accepted into Lane Tech, I jumped up and down while screaming from the top of my lungs. It was a truly joyous moment for me and one I will never forget. #LaneTech4life</h3>
